             <h4>Summary</h4>

             <p class="clear">After their mother's death in a fire when they're just children, Sam and Dean Winchester, along 
             with their father, John, spend their life hunting the demon that killed her: "The Yelllow-Eyed Demon". All the while also saving people
             from random monsters. That's until Sam decides he's had enough and runs off to law school, 
             leaving Dean with their dad.<br><br>>
             
             In the first episode we see Sam at law school, but then Dean breaks into the dorm he shares with
             his girlfriend Jessica to inform him their dad's gone missing on a hunt and asking Sam for help. 
             Sam goes, but after this he'll go back to school and stop hunting definitly. When
              they get back from finishing the 
             hunt their dad started though, Sam goes inside his dorm, and immediatly sees Jessica on the ceiling,
             blood dripping from her body, the appartment catches fire. Jessica dies the same way Sam and 
             Dean's mother died all those years ago. Sam goes back to Dean and they begin their search for
            their father.<br><br>

            Sam and Dean hunt monsters such as vampires, Bloody Mary, ghosts, while searching for their father.
            They discover Sam is a psychic and there are more people like him with special abilities, 
            who all were visited by the Yellow-Eyed Demon exactly when they were 6 months old. They reunite with their
            father, who has found a way to kill the Yellow-Eyed Demon: the Colt, a gun that can kill anything.
            But someone else is after the gun too: Meg, a demon that works for the Yellow-Eyed Demon.<br><br>

            In the last episode Meg has kidnapped John. They lure Meg into Bobby Singer's, an old friend, house
            and exorcise Meg. They go to rescue John but the Yellow-Eyed Demon appears. They fight and the demon flees
            The season ends with the Winchesters getting hit by a truck.</p>
