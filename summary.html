            is saved and John is dead. Before John dies, he tells Dean that if he can't 
            save Sam from becoming evil he will have to kill him.<br><br>

            They meet Ruby, who saves them from a few demons, at first she says
             she's a hunter, she knows about Azazel (The Yellow-Eyed Demon), and Sam confronts
             her, asking how she knows so much, she reveals she's actually a demon. Sam wants to fight her,
             but stops when she promises to help break Dean's deal.<br><br>

             There's also Bela, an antagonist that knows about the supernatural

             to get it back, but he discovers she bartered it off to Lilith, a high-ranking demon,

             but they still lock up inside a room and line the doors and windows with goofer dust, which 
             keeps hellhounds out. Suddenly Ruby demands the demon-killing knife and they discover she's actually Lilith now,
             she holds Sam against the wall, who still begs for his brother, but she ignores him and lets the 
             hellhounds in. They tear Dean to shreds. Lilith goes to kill Sam, but sees her power has no hold over 
             him anymore, and flees. The last shot is of Dean in hell, strung up and calling Sam's name.
