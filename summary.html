            a deal: the Colt and his own life for Dean's. The demon takes the deal, Dean
            is saved and John is dead. Before John dies, he tells Dean that if he can't 
            save Sam from becoming evil he will have to kill him.<br><br>

            Through a voicemail for their dad the boys meet Ellen and her daughter Jo, who run a roadhouse
            specifically for hunters. They hunt a lot of monsters, including ghosts, a djinn and demons. <br><br>

            Sam gets kidnapped by the Yellow-Eyed Demon and gets put in a town with the other special children,

            too late. The crypt is open and demons and spirits are pouring out. Then Dean sees the Colt that the demon gave to Jake and

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Hundreds of demons have been released from hell, and Sam and Dean
            are set on sending as much of them back while also trying to find a way
            to break Dean's deal that he made saving Sam that made it so he'd die in a year.
            <br><br>

            They meet Ruby, who saves them from a few demons, at first she says
             she's a hunter, she knows about Azazel (The Yellow-Eyed Demon), and Sam confronts
             her, asking how she knows so much, she reveals she's actually a demon. Sam wants to fight her,
             but stops when she promises to help break Dean's deal. Dean keeps insisting that she can't be trusted,
             and even wants to kill her, but is stopped by Sam.<br><br>

             There's also Bela, an antagonist that knows about the supernatural
             but uses it to make money by scamming and stealing instead of saving people.
             She clashes with the Winchesters several times. She steals the Colt, and Dean goes
             to get it back, but he discovers she bartered it off to Lilith, a high-ranking demon,
             in an attempt to break the deal she made to kill her abusive father. Bela's times
             is almost up and she begs Dean to help her, but he refuses and she gets ripped to shreds by 
             hellhounds.<br><br>

             The boys discover that Lilith holds all hell contracts so they go to kill her,
             together with Ruby. Ruby says Sam has to use his psychic powers but Dean refuses.
              Lilith is currently possesing a little girl and terrorising her family.
             But when they finally corner her, Lilith is gone. Dean accepts he is going to die,
             but they still lock up inside a room and line the doors and windows with goofer dust, which 
             keeps hellhounds out. Suddenly Ruby demands the demon-killing knife and they discover she's actually Lilith now,
             she holds Sam against the wall, who still begs for his brother, but she ignores him and lets the 
             hellhounds in. They tear Dean to shreds. Lilith goes to kill Sam, but sees her power has no hold over 
             him anymore, and flees. The last shot is of Dean in hell, strung up and calling Sam's name.

             <h4>Summary</h4>

             <p>The season starts with Dean literally crawling out of his grave. He reunites with Sam and Bobby,
             but they don't know who or what brought Dean back. After learning the creature's name: Castiel, Dean 
             and Bobby decide to just summon it. Castiel comes, and he reveals he is an Angel of the Lord, sent to hell to save 
             Dean because God has work for him.<br><br>

             Meanwhile Sam is meeting up with Ruby, who has now found a new vessel, and he's been working
             with her to develop his psychic powers by drinnking Ruby's blood, because demon blood 
             makes him more powerful.<br><br>

             Dean gets sent back in time by Castiel where he meets Mary Campbell and John Winchester, his parents,
             still young and just
             dating. He discovers that his mother's parents (Samuel and Deanna) were hunters too, which Mary would never tell John. Dean doesn't know what
             to do until he comes by Azazel (The Yellow-Eyed Demon), he's determined to kill it to save his parents. He fails,
             the demon kills his grandparents, and then his father, the demon offers Mary to bring him back to life, a deal,
             but he doesn't want her soul, he wants the permission to visit her baby. She takes the deal. Dean is pulled back to the present,
             Castiel tells him he couldn't change anything, he just had to see the whole truth.<br><br>

             They meet the prophet Chuck, who has dreams about the lives of the Winchesters and has written
             books about them the "Supernatural" books.

             Castiel and specialist angel Uriel tell the brothers the demons are working to bring about
             the apocalypse by freeing Lucifer from his cage in hell. To do this 66 seals had to be broken,
             and the first one had broke already: when a righteous man shed blood in hell, which refferred to Dean torturing souls 
             in hell. Now they had to stop the seals from breaking further.<br><br>

             Angels are being killed, they assume it is the demons, so they grab Alastair and tell Dean to torture
              him like he tortured in hell. Dean does reluctantly, but Alastair breaks free he fights, but then Sam arrives.
              He reveals he can now kill demons instead of just sending them back to hell. In his dying moments Alastair says
              it's not demons that have been killing angels. It turns out to be Uriel, who wants to raise Lucifer and asks 
              Castiel to join him, Castiel refuses and kills him.<br><br>

            Dean and Bobby put Sam in a panic room now they've discovered he's addicted to demon blood to detox. But Castiel let's 
            him out, after which he's confronted by Anna but to which he responds he's only following orders. Sam meets up with Ruby
            and drinks more of her blood. She tells him only the first demon, Lilith, can break the final seal so
            Sam sets out to kill her. <br><br>

            Meanwhile Dean is with the angels Castiel and Zachariah, who finally admits heaven doesn't want to stop 
            the apocalypse, but finally defeat hell and bring about paradise, he doesn't care about human lives lost. 
            Dean becomes angry and convinces Castiel, who was considering disobedience, to take him to Sam. Castiel takes him to Chuck the prophetty
            to find out where Sam is, but stays behind to fight the archangel that protects prophets and sneds Dean to Sam. He storms in 
            just as Sam kills Lilith. Ruby then reveals she's been working for Lucifer this whole time,
            Sam killing Lilith was the last seal. Sam and Dean kill Ruby, but it's too late: Lucifer is rising.

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Sam and Dean are trapped with Lucifer being freed, when they're suddenly transported to an airplane above the church
            where Lucifer was released and they see the church destroyed. They travel to Chuck's house, where Chuck tells them Castiel died 
            fighting the archangel. Zachariah appears and he reveals that Sam and Dean are the designated vessels for Michael and Lucifer,
            for them to fight each other in the apocalypse. Just as Zachariah begins to torture Sam and Dean to convince them
            to be the vessels, Castiel appears and kills Zachariah's minions. Zachariah is scared by whatever brought Castiel back and flees.<br><br>

            Castiel tells the brothers he is going to search for God, but after getting killed by hunters that are angry Sam caused the apocalypse
            they go to heaven, where people relive their favourite memories. They meet up again and also meet their mother. But just as they are in their 
            childhood home, Zachariah appears, determined to make the brothers say yes to Michael and Lucifer. Just as they start fighting, another angel
            appears, he says he is Joshua and says he needs to speak to the Winchesters. He transports them to a garden, where he informs them God
            doesn't care, that he thinks he did enough by reviving Castiel and putting the brothers on the airplane.<br><br>

            They meet Crowley, a demon that's the King of the Crossroads. The Winchesters go to him to get the Colt, as a way to potentially kill Lucifer.
            He gives this gladly, as he thinks that after he's destroyed humanity, Lucifer would turn to the demons next. He also tells the boys 
            where they can find Lucifer.<br><br>

            They go to kill Lucifer together with Castiel, Bobby, Ellen and Jo, but it goes wrong and the latter two don't survive, mother and daughter
            sacrifising themselves to save the others. They discover the Colt does not work on Lucifer.<br><br>

            The brothers and Castiel meet the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, War, who's making people kill each other, thinking the other is a demon, Pestilence,
            who works in a hospital and makes people deadly sick, and Famine, who makes people hunger for their biggest desire, resulting
            in some people eating each other and Sam drinking demon blood again. They discover the power comes from the Horsemen's rings, which they take.<br><br>

            Dean begins contemplating giving himself up, saying yes to Michael, but then they discover the angels have brought back Adam, Sam and Dean's youner
            half-brother. Since he is of the same blood they can use him as Michael's vessel, even though he would not be as perfect as Dean. DEan definetley
            does not want Adam to be the vessel, so he goes to say yes, but is stopped by Castiel, who angrily says he gave everything for Dean around
            now Dean is giving up.<br><br>

            They find a way to trap Lucifer back in the cage, which they all have, except one: Death's. Crowley tells them where he is and Dean goes to meet Death,
            who gives Dean his ring willingly because Lucifer has bound him to kill people and he does not like that.
