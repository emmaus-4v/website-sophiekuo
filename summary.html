            is saved and John is dead. Before John dies, he tells Dean that if he can't 
            save Sam from becoming evil he will have to kill him.<br><br>

            Through a voicemail for their dad the boys meet Ellen and her daughter Jo, who run a roadhouse

            too late. The crypt is open and demons and spirits are pouring out. Then Dean sees the Colt that the demon gave to Jake and

            but the distraction is what Dean needs to grab the colt and kill the demon. They close the Devil's Gate and John ascends into heaven.

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Hundreds of demons have been released from hell, and Sam and Dean
            are set on sending as much of them back while also trying to find a way

            <br><br>

            They meet Ruby, who saves them from a few demons, at first she says
             she's a hunter, she knows about Azazel (The Yellow-Eyed Demon), and Sam confronts
             her, asking how she knows so much, she reveals she's actually a demon. Sam wants to fight her,
             but stops when she promises to help break Dean's deal. Dean keeps insisting that she can't be trusted,
             and even wants to kill her, but is stopped by Sam.<br><br>

             There's also Bela, an antagonist that knows about the supernatural
             but uses it to make money by scamming and stealing instead of saving people.
             She clashes with the Winchesters several times. She steals the Colt, and Dean goes
             to get it back, but he discovers she bartered it off to Lilith, a high-ranking demon,
             in an attempt to break the deal she made to kill her abusive father. Bela's times
             is almost up and she begs Dean to help her, but he refuses and she gets ripped to shreds by 
             hellhounds.<br><br>

             together with Ruby. Ruby says Sam has to use his psychic powers but Dean refuses.
              Lilith is currently possesing a little girl and terrorising her family.
             But when they finally corner her, Lilith is gone. Dean accepts he is going to die,
             but they still lock up inside a room and line the doors and windows with goofer dust, which 
             keeps hellhounds out. Suddenly Ruby demands the demon-killing knife and they discover she's actually Lilith now,
             she holds Sam against the wall, who still begs for his brother, but she ignores him and lets the 
             hellhounds in. They tear Dean to shreds. Lilith goes to kill Sam, but sees her power has no hold over 
             him anymore, and flees. The last shot is of Dean in hell, strung up and calling Sam's name.

             Dean because God has work for him.<br><br>

             Meanwhile Sam is meeting up with Ruby, who has now found a new vessel, and he's been working
             with her to develop his psychic powers by drinnking Ruby's blood, because demon blood 
             makes him more powerful.<br><br>

             still young and just
             dating. He discovers that his mother's parents (Samuel and Deanna) were hunters too, which Mary would never tell John. Dean doesn't know what

             and the first one had broke already: when a righteous man shed blood in hell, which refferred to Dean torturing souls 
             in hell. Now they had to stop the seals from breaking further.<br><br>

             Angels are being killed, they assume it is the demons, so they grab Alastair and tell Dean to torture
              him like he tortured in hell. Dean does reluctantly, but Alastair breaks free he fights, but then Sam arrives.
              He reveals he can now kill demons instead of just sending them back to hell. In his dying moments Alastair says

              Castiel to join him, Castiel refuses and kills him.<br><br>
