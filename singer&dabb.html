            Lost & Found</span> and ended on May 17 2018 with <span id="episode">Let the Good Times Roll</span>.

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Dean and Sam are left reeling from the loss of so many allies and family members and their new responsibility to 'raise' Jack, with
             Sam willing to give the boy a chance while Dean is immediately concerned due to his heritage. In the other world, 
             Lucifer keeps Mary alive as a hostage to trade for his son when he returns home, but finds himself confronted by the 
             alternate Michael, who has killed his Lucifer and won the war. Although Dean becomes increasingly bitter at their recent 
             losses, he gains a new sense of hope when Jack unintentionally brings Castiel back to life. Things become complicated when
              Men of Letters Arthur Ketch is revealed to have escaped death through a spell he received from Rowena, Ketch taking 
              Castiel and a weakened Lucifer prisoner after Lucifer escapes back into this world when Michael tries to use his grace 
              to create a portal so that he can conquer the other reality.<br><br>

While the Winchesters' efforts to return to the other world to rescue Mary fail, Ketch is revealed to be working with Asmodeus, 
who reveals in turn that the source of his power is Gabriel, who actually faked his death during his confrontation with Lucifer
 but was sold to Asmodeus by the children of the real Loki. After their first attempt to enter the other world traps Jack in that 
 reality, the Winchesters retrieve the demon tablet, a translation of it reveals the ingredients needed to open a portal to the 
 other world. As Jack sides with Mary and the humans against the angels, the Winchesters and Castiel gather the ingredients for
  the spell to open the portal while Lucifer tries to re-establish himself as king of Heaven in the absence of God and other 
  archangels. After Ketch rescues Gabriel, allowing the Winchesters to use his grace as part of the spell, the initial raid on 
  the other world fails to achieve more than Dean rescuing the alternate version of his deceased friend Charlie Bradbury, but
   Gabriel flees in fear after an attack on the bunker by Asmodeus. With Heaven in desperate straits after Lucifer fails to hold 
   the angels together, Castiel is charged with finding Gabriel while the last ten angels try to keep Heaven in order, leaving 
   the Winchesters to mount a new assault on the other world with Gabriel and Lucifer. They are able to rescue a range of human 
   survivors from the other world, including the alternate versions of Bobby and Charlie, but Gabriel is killed in the process 
   and Lucifer and the alternate Michael follow them through.<br><br>

As Lucifer takes Jack's power for himself, Dean is forced to make a deal to act as the vessel for the alternate Michael to
 stop him. Dean is able to stay in control long enough to kill Lucifer, but the season ends with Michael taking control of 
 Dean's body and departing. </p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            
            <p>

Three weeks after Apocalypse World Michael possessed Dean, the archangel is confronting individuals of every different species, questioning 
their wants and dismissing them as hopeless, until he encounters a vampire who expresses his desire to eat. Praising his 
desire as pure, Michael decides to raise monsters above mankind and begins experimenting with archangel grace and monsters,
 making them immune to their former weaknesses. Sam, Bobby from Apocalypse World and Mary track Michael down, and Michael
  seemingly leaves Dean's body after becoming irritated with Dean's resistance. Meanwhile, Jack becomes sick due to the loss 
  of his powers, and dies later, his soul ascending to Heaven. But the Shadow being from the Empty, believing Jack's soul 
  belongs to it and irritated with Castiel for escaping it, attacks Heaven and makes a deal with Castiel to take the angel 
  in place of Jack, but only when Castiel lets himself be happy again.<br><br>

Dean, Sam, Castiel and the newly resurrected Jack decide to take down Michael and his army of monsters once and for all, 
but Michael retakes control of Dean and unleashes his monsters on the city. The group subdue Michael, and Dean takes back 
control of his body and imprisons the archangel in his mind. Dean, with the help of Billie, builds the Ma’lak Box to imprison 
himself in, in order to protect the world from Michael. But Sam convinces Dean that they'll find another solution, and Dean makes
 a wish that brings John Winchester back from the past for a day. Dean is then injured on a hunt, and Michael is unleashed. 
 Michael possesses Rowena temporarily, and kills most of the Apocalypse World hunters, but Jack burns off his soul to murder
  Michael and takes Michael's grace to restore his powers.<br><br>

Nick, who survived Lucifer's death and suffers psychological damage from so many years of being Lucifer's vessel, sets about
 getting justice for the deaths of his family. His killing spree leads him to the prophet Donatello Redfield, and Nick communicates
  with the recently awakened Lucifer in the Empty. Nick tricks Jack into giving him Jack's blood, and tries to resurrect Lucifer 
  to be his vessel again. Jack confronts, and then kills Nick in front of Mary. After Mary berates Jack for viciously murdering 
  Nick, the now soulless Jack kills Mary by accident, leaving the boys without their mother for a second time. Castiel prays for 
  God to return and fix Jack, but the angels manipulate Jack into solidifying their power. Out of options, Sam and Dean imprison 
  Jack in the Mal’ak Box, but Jack escapes. God returns and tells the boys that they must use a gun that he built to kill Jack, 
  but Sam and Dean, frustrated with God's disappearances and inaction, refuse him.<br><br>

Angered at their defiance, God smites Jack, who wakes up to see the Shadow and Billie waiting for him in the Empty.
 God decides to end the world, and unleashes every vengeful spirit from Hell back on Earth and sets an army of corpses upon Sam, 
 Dean and Castiel. </p>
