            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>Dean and Sam are emotionally distraught after the losses of Castiel, Mary and even Crowley. They now have to raise Jack, Sam wants to give the boy a chance while Dean thinks he's inherently evil because of his father. In the Apocalypse world, 
            Lucifer decides to keep Mary with him as someone to trade for Jack when he gets to the original world, but they find themselves stopped by the 
            alternate Michael, who fought with his Lucifer in the apocalyose and won. Dean gains new hope when Jack manages to wake Castiel in the Empty, where angels and demons go after their death, and Castiel manages to get out. Things become complicated when
            Man of Letters Arthur Ketch is revealed to have escaped death through a spell and he takes 
            Castiel and a weakened Lucifer prisoner after Lucifer gets back into his world when Michael tries  
            to create a portal so that he can take over the other world.<br><br>

            While the boys' efforts to return to the Apocalypse world to rescue Mary fail, Ketch is revealed to be working with demon Asmodeus, 
            who then reveals the source of his power is actually archangel Gabriel, who faked his death and hid
            but was sold to Asmodeus by pagan gods. While trying to cross, Jack gets stuck in the Apocalypse world. The Winchesters get the demon tablet, which says the ingredients for the spell needed to open a portal to the Apocalypse world.

            Ketch rescues Gabriel and brings him to the boys' bunker, allowing the Winchesters to use his grace as part of the spell, the initial raid on 
            the other world fails to achieve more than Dean rescuing the alternate version of his dead friend Charlie Bradbury, but
            Gabriel flees after Asmodeus attacks the bunker. With Heaven desperate after Lucifer leaves, Castiel is charged with finding Gabriel while the last few angels try to keep Heaven in order, leaving

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            
            <p>A few weeks after Alternate Michael possessed Dean, the archangel is getting individuals of every different species, questioning 
            their wants and dismissing them as hopeless, until he encounters a vampire who expresses his desire to eat. Assesing his 
            desire as pure, Michael decides to raise monsters above mankind and begins experimenting with his own grace and monsters,
            making them immune to their former weaknesses. Sam, Bobby from Apocalypse World and Mary track Michael down, and Michael
            seemingly leaves Dean's body after becoming irritated with Dean's resistance. Meanwhile, Jack becomes sick due to the loss 
            of his powers, and dies later, his soul ascending to Heaven. But the Empty, believing Jack's soul 
            belongs to it since he's half angel, attacks Heaven and makes a deal with Castiel to take the him 
            in place of Jack, but only when Castiel has a moment of true happiness.<br><br>

           Dean, Sam, Castiel and the newly resurrected Jack want to take down Michael and his army, 
           but Michael retakes control of Dean through a backdoor he left for himself and unleashes his monsters on the city. The group subdue Michael, and Dean takes back 
           control of his body and imprisons the archangel in his mind. Dean, with the help of Billie, builds a Ma’lak Box, impossible to break out of even for an archangel, to imprison 
           himself in, in order to protect the world from Michael. But Sam convinces Dean that they'll find another way. Dean is then injured on a hunt, and Michael gets out of his cage in Dean's mind. 
           Michael possesses Rowena, the witch, and kills most of the Apocalypse World people, but Jack burns off his entire soul to kill
           Michael and takes Michael's grace to restore his powers.<br><br>

           Nick, Lucifer's vessel who survived Lucifer's death, suffers murderous urges from being Lucifer's vessel, sets about
           getting justice for the deaths of his wife and baby, that were brutally murdered. He goes on a killing spree that leads him to the prophet Donatello, and Nick communicates
           with Lucifer in the Empty. Nick tricks Jack into giving him his's blood, and attempts to resurrect Lucifer 
           to be his vessel again. Jack, morally ambigious without a soul, kills Nick brutally. Mary berates him for this, while Jack gets more and more upset until he snaps and kills Mary accidently,
           leaving the boys without their mother for a second time. Castiel prays for 
           God to return and fix Jack, but the angels manipulate Jack into solidifying their power. Out of options, Sam and Dean imprison 
           Jack in the Mal’ak Box, but Jack escapes. He gets angry at the world and commands everyone to stop lying, after which suddenly no one can lie anymore. God returns, threatened by Jack's power, and tells the boys that they must use a gun that he built, the Equalizer, to kill Jack, 
           but Sam and Dean, after noticing God doesn't actually care and enjoys their pain similar to a TV show, refuse this.<br><br>

           Angry at their refusal to bend to his will, God smites Jack, who wakes up in the Empty. God then releases hordes of spirits out of Hell and sets angry corpses on Sam,
           Dean and Castiel. </p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>In the final season they pick off where they left off: in the graveyard, Jack dead and an army of vengeful corpses attacking Sam, Dean and Castiel.
                They are stuck in a crypt when a demon enters Jack's body named Belphegor. They get out of the graveyard with the demon's help, but the town they are 
                in is infested with angry spirits. They call Rowena, the witch, and Ketch, now a regular hunter, for help. They manage to put the spirits back in Hell,
                but after Belphegor betrays them, it costs them Rowena and Ketch. Dean is angry at Castiel for not sticking with the plan, even though Belphegor was using them, and is also
                still angry at Castiel for Mary's death,
                since God is now supposedly gone, Castiel leaves.<br><br>

                They discover God is not gone, because Sam shot him with the gun that was meant for Jack, the equalizer, and now Sam and God have mathcing wounds. 
                God captures Sam, and tries to convince him there's no hope by showing him flashes of a future where God is gone, meanwhile Dean and a returned Castiel
                go to Purgatory for an ingredient for the spell to trap God. Dean and Castiel prepare the spell, but when Sam has to do his part, he's too late because God succeeded 
                in making him lose hope, because of this, the wounds dissapear. God reveals his big ending is having Sam and Dean kill each other, Dean replies they won't do it, 
                God replies the other Sam's and Dean's didn't think they'd do it either.<br><br>

                Jack is brought back by Billie, death, to defeat God. She apparantly has a big master plan to kill God. As part of this plan, Jack eats angel's hearts and gets his soul back.
                The final step is going to Adam, the first man, to get his rib, Jack absorbs this rib which makes him a black hole for celestial energy like God and his siter the Darkness. Meanwhile
                Sam gets doubts about the plan and discovers Billie is planning on just becoming the next God and putting everyone back where they're supposed to be, like the people from Apocalypse world or
                angels like Castiel. He goes to tell Dean this and convinces him to stop the plan, but Jack is set to blow, so Billie sends him to the Empty for a short while, where he explodes.<br><br>

                After Jack blows they fight Billie and manage to nick her arm with her own weapon, she dissapears. After this people suddenly start dissapearing, they assume it is Billie's doing, so 
                Dean and Castiel go to murder her, while Sam and Jack try to keep people safe within a warded building. Dean and Cas go to Death's library, but while fighting Billie tells them she 
                is already dying and the people dying is not her doing, but she decides her last wish is to kill Dean. She curses Dean, causing him pain, and Dean flees, leaning on Castiel. They lock themselves in a room and ward it,
                but it will not take long before she gets in. They are hopeless, until Castiel remembers his deal with the Empty, he tells Dean about this, and after a speech about how Dean is a beautiful, loving person, he confesses
                his love for Dean, which makes him so happy the Empty comes and takes him and Billie. Meanwhile everyone in the world dissapears, leaving only Sam, Dean and Jack.<br><br>

                Back in the bunker, Jack feels another presence, which turns out to be Michael, the archangel. The only way to kill God is in God's book from Death's library, but only Death can read it. 
                Dean gets called by "Castiel", he rushes to the door, but it turns out to be Lucifer, who says the empty kicked him out. He brings a reaper, which he kills so she becomes Death. She begins to read the book,
                but Lucifer quickly kills her and grabs the open book. He reveals God actually brought him back, he fights with Michael, who kills him. Sam says the book is partly in Enochian and he pieces together a spell,
                they go to perform it but it turns out Michael ratted them out to God. He says he serves God first and apologizes to God, but God still kills Michael. Then Sam reveals they only pretended to 
                read the book, they knew Michael would betray them. Jack had actually been absorbing celestial energy the whole time, from Lucifer's and Michael's deaths, Jack grabs God and absorbs all his power. 
                God is now mortal and the boys decide to let him live as a human. Jack is now God and dissapears. <br><br>

                In the last episode, Dean dies on a standard hunt by being pushed on a rebar sticking out of a wall. He goes to Heaven, where he meets the original Bobby, who informs him Heaven 
                has been rebuilt by Jack and an apparantly ressurected Castiel. Everyone now lives peacefully with all their loved ones. Meanwhile Sam stops hunting and has a son names Dean with a faceless spouse, 
                he dies at an old age and reunites with Dean in Heaven.</p>
