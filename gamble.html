            <p>The sixth season takes place a year after the  the fifth season, with Dean living a 
            normal life with Lisa and Ben. When Sam suddenly returns to Dean, strangely emotionless, he is forced to 
            leave his life with Lisa and Ben behind and work with Sam and his extended family, including his 
            ressurected grandpa Samuel Campbell, to capture Alpha 
            monsters for Crowley. Meanwhile Castiel is fighting a Civil War against Raphael in Heaven.<br><br>
            
             Dean does not trust Samuel 
            and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds him working with demons to go after Purgatory, where creatures
            go where they die. Dean discovers that Sam doesn't have a soul, which is still in the Cage, so he tries to get Death
            to retrieve it. He does, but to save Sam the trauma of his memories in the cage at he hands of Lucifer, Death blocks those memories
            using a mental wall. The second half of the seaason is about the Mother of All, mother of monsters, which  
            leads to events which prove that Castiel was the one that brought Sam back, and he's responsible for the hunt for the
             Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory, all the while he was also working with Crowley. He does this so he can use
             the souls in purgatory to make himself powerful and defeat Raphael. When the
              Winchesters try to stop Castiel, he destroys Death's mental wall in Sam, bringing back the memories of the cage,
               and proceeds with his plan, 
            absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and calling himself God. </p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>After absorbing souls from Purgatory and declaring himself God, Castiel begins 
            to punish all the bad people in the world, such as a homophobic pastor
            and corrupt politicians. He discovers that with the souls he also absorbed the Leviathans, ancient creatures
            God himself locked up,
             who are attempting to escape from Castiel's vessel. Castiel sees he's not going to last much longer and goes to 
             Sam and Dean for help. They return the souls 
             to Purgatory but the Leviathans cling on to Castiel, then they seemingly kill Castiel and scatter all over the world.
             <br><br>
             
             They learn that the Leviathans' 
             weakness is Sodium Borate (also known as Borax) and they can be killed with it, though it doesn't do much to the leader 
              Dick Roman. After Dick kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and 
             learns of a facility to cure cancer they have. The 
             ghost of Bobby confirms that while they are curing cancer, they are doing it to turn humanity into the perfect food source for them.
            It turns out Castiel was not dead, but had amnesia, after remembering who he was, he takes on Sam's Hell trauma,
            which turns him kind of crazy but he does still function. They also meet Kevin, the new prophet, Kevin can read the word of God and helps Sam and Dean decipher it
              to stop the Leviathans. With the help of Castiel and Kevin, the brothers learn that 
             the only way to kill the Leviathans is with the "bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the 
             fallen".  Eventually, Dean and Castiel kill Dick but are blasted into Purgatory together as a result,
             while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are gone. </p>
