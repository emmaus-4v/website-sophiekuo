            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>After one year of being in Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth, without Castiel, carrying inside his arm the 
            soul of a vampire named Benny. The Sam and Dean start a fight against Crowley to find the Demon Tablet and lock the
             Gates of Hell, so all demons stay in Hell forever. The brothers use Kevin Tran, the prophet andd only person
             that can read the Tablets of God, to help them read the tablet and 
             close the gates. <br><br>
             
             Castiel is brought back from Purgatory by an angel named Naomi, who controls him and wants to use him to get the Angel Tablet
             and kill Dean, Castiel almost does this but Dean brings him back. While Kevin works on translating the tablet, 
             Sam and Dean meet their grandfather, Henry Winchester, who was a Man of Letters, 
              an organization dedicated to supernatural knowledge. He dissapeared in 1958, but this was actually him using
               a time-travel spell to go to the future and escape the demon Abaddon. Henry is killed protecting 
               Sam and Dean, but he gives them access to the Men of Letters bunker, a bunker where there's many supernatural
               facts and books, which the brothers then take as a new homebase. Kevin translates that three trials must 
               be done to lock the Gates of Hell forever, Sam completes the first two, but Dean ends the trials immediatley after he finds
               out they will kill Sam. Meanwhile, Castiel is tricked 
               by an angel called Metatron into completing another series of trials that would have allegedly locked all angels in Heaven, 
               so Castiel could fix things there, but
               actually banished every angel apart from Metatron to Earth,
             the season ended with the angels falling from the sky like meteorites, their wings burning off, and Castiel looking up at them, graceless.

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>In the first half of the season, the fallen angels have split in factions and are fighting
            each other, but they also want Castiel as they think it's his fault they fell. 
            Sam is now in a coma from 
             the trials to close the gates of hell and Dean is desperate to let an angel, seemingly Ezekiel, possess Sam to heal him from 
             the inside. Dean must hide Ezekiel's presence from Sam and even turns the newly human Castiel away at Ezekiel's 
             insistence.
            Eventually it is revealed that Ezekiel is 
            actually angel Gadreel, the angel who let Lucifer into the Garden of Eden and was imprisoned until the Fall. Gadreel kills prophet Kevin and escapes 
            to join Metatron, who is currentley ruling Heaven, killing another angel and taking his grace. With
             the demon Crowley's help, Sam throws Gadreel out, but the brothers split apart because of this.<br><br>

In the second half of the season, Dean is searching for both Gadreel for revenge and the First Blade to kill the high demon Abaddon with
 the help of, now king of Hell, Crowley. Despite Cain's and Crowley's warnings, Dean takes on the Mark of Cain in order to
  be able to use the First Blade. After finally healing Sam, Castiel begins a search for Metatron, 
  to make him return the angels to Heaven. Another two factions begin, under Metraton and Castiel. Eventually Dean kills
   Abaddon and Castiel defeats Metatron after Gadreel sacrifices himself to let Castiel confront 
   Metatron, but Metatron murders Dean with his own First Blade, causing Dean to become a demon due to the Mark 
   of Cain. </p>

            Brother's Keeper</span>

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>In the tenth season, Dean is now a Prince of Hell, 
            working with Crowley. Meanwhile, Sam searches for Dean. After Dean rebels against Crowley
            after realizing he's much more powerful, Crowley gives Sam his 
            location. In return, Sam gives Crowley the First Blade. Sam, with the help 
            of Castiel, cures Dean by using pure human blood. But even though he is not a demon anymore,
            the Mark of Cain is still a problem. On a case involving Castiel's vessel's daughter Claire, Dean ends up slaughtering several men who are keeping her captive and loses control
               of the Mark, a nightmare he previously had.<br><br>

A new witch comes into play, being revealed to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. New hope for ridding
 Dean of the Mark of Cain comes when Charlie, the human computer hacker, comes across the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using the 
 tome, and turns to Rowena for help. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered 
 by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After murdering the Steins, nearly 
 killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts getting desperate to be free of the Mark, causing
  him to ask Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away from the Earth, but says Dean
   must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. After some arguing, Sam and Dean both agree that it is for the good 
   of the world. At the last moment however, Dean kills Death instead to save Sam. Rowena then successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a creature 
   older than time
    that had been locked away by the Mark. 
Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned. </p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>In the eleventh season, Sam and Dean deal with the release of Amara/The Darkness, 
            after Rowena's spell freed her by removing the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm. While Crowley's taking 
            care of Amara, feeding her with souls, to get her onn his side, the brothers and Castiel are trying to 
            find a way to get rid of The Darkness. In order to find out more about the Darkness, Castiel asks Metatron for
             help, and he says that before the world was created, God locked up his sister, the Darkness, in a cage 
             closed by the Mark.
              To face the most dangerous creature they've crossed paths with so far, the brothers ask for 
              Lucifer's help in the cage. Lucifer claims he's the only one who can beat Amara, but he 
              needs to possess Sam's body. When Sam refuses, Lucifer tries to kill Dean, Sam, and Castiel, 
              but Rowena's spell seems to have sent him away. Later, it's revealed that Castiel said "yes" 
              at the last second, and that Lucifer is now possessing his body.<br><br>

When nothing works to get rid of The Darkness, Amara claims that God must appear himself to see her destroying 
everything He created and loves. Then, she decides to draw out God by torturing an archangel, making 
Lucifer/Castiel scream in agony. Meanwhile, Chuck returns and reveals himself to Metatron, telling him he 
is God. Then, he reveals himself to the Winchesters and they all decide to seal Amara. Rowena, who had cast 
a spell that made her immortal, helps them with a spell, while Crowley and Lucifer use the demons and angels 
in a combined attack against Amara. When Chuck tried to seal Amara, she resisted, stopping the Winchesters, 
apparently killing Lucifer and gravely wounding Chuck. Amara warns that Chuck is not dead yet because he is 
going to watch her destroy everything ever created.<br><br>

As a result of Chuck's injuries, the world is now dying. Realizing that the only 
chance for the world to survive is to kill the Darkness along with Chuck, so the universe stays in balance,
 the Winchesters begin gathering
 spirits to create a bomb to destroy the Darkness. With the help of Billie the Reaper, they are able to get 
 the needed souls which are inserted into Dean. Chuck sends Dean to Amara who has started to regret her actions 
 and Dean convinces Amara that revenge is not worth it. Amara and Chuck make up and Amara heals Chuck of the
  damage she did to him. The two then leave, but not before Amara tells Dean she is going to give him
  what he wants most for helping her. At the bunker, Castiel is banished by a woman who identifies herself as 
  Lady Antonia Bevell of the London chapter of the Men of Letters. Antonia tells Sam the Men of Letters have 
  sent her to bring Sam in for punishment for his actions and fires her gun, apparently 
at Sam as he tries to talk her down. Making his way through the woods, Dean finds a ressurected Mary Winchester.</p>
