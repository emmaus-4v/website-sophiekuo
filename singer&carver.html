            October 3 2012 with <span id="episode">We Need To Talk About Kevin</span>

            <h4>Summary</h4>

            <p>After one year of being in Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth, without Castiel, carrying inside his arm the 
            soul of a vampire named Benny. The Sam and Dean start a fight against Crowley to find the Demon Tablet and lock the
             Gates of Hell, so all demons stay in Hell forever. The brothers use Kevin Tran, the prophet andd only person
             that can read the Tablets of God, to help them read the tablet and 
             close the gates. <br><br>
             
             Castiel is brought back from Purgatory by an angel named Naomi, who controls him and wants to use him to get the Angel Tablet
             and kill Dean, Castiel almost does this but Dean brings him back. While Kevin works on translating the tablet, 
             Sam and Dean meet their grandfather, Henry Winchester, who was a Man of Letters, 
              an organization dedicated to supernatural knowledge. He dissapeared in 1958, but this was actually him using
               a time-travel spell to go to the future and escape the demon Abaddon. Henry is killed protecting 
               Sam and Dean, but he gives them access to the Men of Letters bunker, a bunker where there's many supernatural
               facts and books, which the brothers then take as a new homebase. Kevin translates that three trials must 
               be done to lock the Gates of Hell forever, Sam completes the first two, but Dean ends the trials immediatley after he finds
               out they will kill Sam. Meanwhile, Castiel is tricked 
               by an angel called Metatron into completing another series of trials that would have allegedly locked all angels in Heaven, 
               so Castiel could fix things there, but
               actually banished every angel apart from Metatron to Earth,
             the season ended with the angels falling from the sky like meteorites, their wings burning off, and Castiel looking up at them, graceless.
