            Eventually he makes a deal with the Empty, basically Death for angels and demons, that if he ever feels truly happy it will summon
            them, to save his adopted son Jack. In season 15, Death is chasing him and Dean, and by confessing that he is in love with Dean,
            he gives himself a true moment of happiness and summons the Empty, which takes him and Death, and he saves the man he loves for the last time.
            Later it is mentioned he is eventually ressurected again by Jack and is reforming Heaven with him.

            <h4>Trivia</h4>

            <ul id="list">
             <li>Castiel is one of the most popular characters of the show. 3 different attempts have been made to kill him off, but because
             of fan's protests he was ressurected again and again.</li>
             <li>Because he believed Castiel would only be in 6 episodes max Misha Collins used a deep gravelly voice for the angel, which he 
             later regretted because it hurts his throat.</li>
             <li>Castiel is the only main character and angel confirmed to be LGBT+. There are however people who deny this and say that Castiel's love
             confession is actually platonic, despite Dean actually reciprocating in the Spanish version of the series and Cas saying "the one
             thing I want, it's something I know I can't have", referring to how he does not think Dean sees him romantically. The love confession
             finally made the massively popular ship "Destiel" happen, which was wanted by fans everywhere.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="jack">Jack Kline</h4>

            <p class="spnquotes"id="spnquote">"I'm around. I'll be in every drop of falling rain, every speck of dust that the wind blows, and in the sand, in the rocks, and the sea. (...) And those answers will be in each of them. Maybe not today but... someday. People don't need to pray to me or to sacrifice to me. They just need to know that I'm already a part of them and to trust in that. I won't be hands on. Chuck put himself in the story. That was his mistake. But I learned from you and my mother and Castiel that... when
                 people have to be their best... they can be. And that's what to believe in. Well... I'm really as close as this. Goodbye. "<br><span id="quotations">
            - Jack</span></p>
            <P>Jack Kline, played by Alexander Calvert, is one of the main characters of Supernatural. He's appeared from season 12 - 15.<br><br>

            <strong>Jack Kline</strong> (b. May 18 2017) is a nephilim. He is the son of Kelly Kline and Lucifer, but because Kelly
            got taken care of by Castiel during her pregnancy, Jack chose Castiel as his father. He gets taken in by Team Free Will
            and with them he learns mastering his powers. Dean is especially wary of him, becasue he's the son of Lucifer, but even he warms
            up to Jack. Jack is massively powerful since a nephilim is more powerful than the angel that sired it, and he has helped
            save the world. In season 15 he absorbes the powers of Michael, Lucifer and God, and then becomes the new God.</P>
