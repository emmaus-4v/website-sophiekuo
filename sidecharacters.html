            Creation and destruction, light and dark, balance. And when we split apart, all this was created."<br><span id="quotations">
            - Amara</span></p>
            <img class="spnimg2"src="afbeeldingen/amara.jpg">
            <p><strong>The Darkness</strong>, or <strong>Amara</strong> is one of the two most powerful beings in the universe, together with her brother, God. She is the main anatagonist of season 11.<br><br>
            
            First she just wants revenge on God (Chuck) for locking her up at the beginning of time. Eventually she reconciles with him and they dissapear together at the end of the season. She returns in season 15, where God asks her
            for help starting over, destroying all universes and making new ones, but she refuses. She initially doesn't take a side, but later she takes the Winchester's because she likes the earth. However
            God and Darkness can't exist without each other, because the universe would be inbalanced, so Dean wants to kill her too. After she discovers this, she let's God absorb her and her power. After
            Jack absorbs God's power, he says he and Amara are living in harmony.</p>

            <h3 id="azazel">Azazel</h3>

            <p class="spnquotes"id="spnquote">"Azazel... was a fanatic. A true believer in Lucifer's "master plan"."<br><span id="quotations">- Ramiel</span></p>
            <img class="spnimg2" src="afbeeldingen/azazel.jpg">
            <p><strong>Azazel</strong> is a Prince of Hell, a powerful demon that serves Lucifer. He was the main antagonist in seasons 1
            and 2.<br><br>

            Ten years after Mary Winchester gives him permisson to take Sam to save John, he walks into little Sammy's 
            nursery and bleeds in his mouth, which gives him powers. Mary walks in and he kills her. He makes other "special
            children" like Sam, how many is not clear. To find the fittest, he grabs a few children at a time and puts them in a 
            ghost town until they kill each other. A man named Jake wins and Azazel uses him to get to the Devil's Gate, where
            he can't get because it's in a giant devil's trap. He opens the gate, but then the Winchesters appear and Dean
            kills Azazel with the Colt.

            <h3 id="billie">Billie</h3>

            <p class="spnquotes"id="spnquote">"It's you, Dean. It's always been you. Death-defying. Rule-breaking. 
            You are everything I lived to set right. To put down. To tame. You are human disorder incarnate."<br><span id="quotations">
            - Billie to Dean</span></p>
            <img class="spnimg2"src="afbeeldingen/billie.jpg">
            <p><strong>Billie</strong> was formerly a reaper, but became Death after the old Death died and she died too. She is the secondary anatagonist of season 15.<br><br>
            
            Her goal at first was to make sure the Winchesters didn't come back to life again when they died. The old 
            Death had apparantley found it funny, but since he died Billie was the reaper in charge. When the brothers
            are caught by the FBI and put in solitary, they basically go insane, so they make a deal with Billie to get them out,
            but in return one of them has to die. When Castiel hears about this, he kills Billie so no Winchester has to die. After
            this she becomes Death, because the first reaper to die after Death is killed becomes Death. In season 15, she helps 
            the Winchesters kill God by bringing back Jack and giving them a plan, but it turns out she only did because she wanted to take over herself. Team Free Will 2.0
            turns on her, and Dean and Castiel go to kill her. She chases them through the bunker and traps them, when she finally 
            bursts in, the Empty is there, summoned by Cas' love confession and his true happiness, and it takes Billie.</p>

            - Gabriel</span></p>
            <img class="spnimg2"src="afbeeldingen/gabriel.jpg">
            <p><strong>Gabriel</strong> was first thought to be a trickster, but turned out to
            be an archangel. He helped the brothers on numerous occasions. <br><br>
            
            He appears first in season 2, tormenting the brothers by sticking Sam in a time loop and making some funny things
            happen at an university. When he sticks the brothers in a television world where they have to play their roles,
            just like they have to play their roles in real life as Michael's and Lucifer's vessels, they discover he is Gabriel,
            the archangel. Later, when Sam and Dean are captured by pagan Gods, Gabriel goes to save them, and when Lucifer shows up,
            Gabriel gets seemingly killed by him. Later it is revealed Lucifer merely killed a clone, the real gabriel went to pagan god Loki and his seasons
            and they helped him hide, but after a while they sold him, because they blamed him for Odin's death at Lucifer's hands. Gabriel was with
            Prince of hell Asmodeus, who tortured him and milked his grace. When Asmodeus kidnaps a human, Arthur Ketch, and he sees Gabriel he decides 
            to rescue Gabriel and flee to the Winchesters. Gabriel goes with the others to the Apocalypse world, where he stays behind to buy the 
            boys time and gets killed by Alternate Michael.</p>

            <p class="spnquotes"id="spnquote">"Those other toys, they don't spark joy. But Sam and Dean, the real Sam and Dean, they do. 
            They challenge me... they disappoint me... they surprise me. They're the ones. " <br><span id="quotations">
            - God</span></p>
            <img class="spnimg2"src="afbeeldingen/god.png">
            <p><strong>God</strong>, or <strong>Chuck</strong> was first thought to be a prophet who had dreams baout the Winchesters,
            but later he revealed to be the creator of the universe. He is the main antagonist of season 15.<br><br>
            
            The brothers and Castiel first meet Chuck because he wrote a book series based on his dreams about them: the Supernatural books.
            They go to his house and Castiel says that he is a prophet. He helps the Winchesters several times, but eventually they assume he 
            is dead because Kevin became a prophet and there can only be one prophet at the same time. He reappeared in season 11 to the brothers, to stop
            his sister, the Darkness. He is at first shown to be lovable, if not a bit disconnected from the beings he created. He doesn't defeat
            Amara but instead makes up with her and they dissapear. He appears again at the end of season 14, concerned about Jack's enormous power, and
            tells the brothers and Cas to kill him. They go to do that, but then Sam notices Chuck is enjoying this, he calls him out, so Chuck
            kills Jack himself and plunges them into chaos before dissapearing. His goal in season 15 is to start over, create new universes and discard
            the old ones, but he is not at full power, because Sam shot him with the Equalizer, which was originally for killing Jack. But even after the 
            wound heals, he still wants to beat the Winchesters. He thinks he has it all in hand, because his son Michael turned on the boys, but turns
            out they lied to Michael. Jack had been absorbing power from Lucifer and Michael, and then he drained Chuck's power too, leaving him a simple human.
